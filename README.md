Hi!

<h1> It``s "WEATHER-FORECAST" application.</h1>

Easy for using.
You could get forecast for today or for 5 days further.
<br><br>
Pull this repository and run "**npm install**".<br>
Be informed, that for correct work this app sends requests to **https://openweathermap.org/** and reqiures **API-key** from this web-site.<br>
Please, sign up at that web-site before usage this app and get your *personal API-key* from there.
<br><br>
When you start app at your localhost (and launch it in your IDE), application will ask you input your API-key in browser.

In other case **app will not work**.
<br>
That`s a test version of this app.
